Framework: JUCE


Audio Plug-In, uses C++ for audio processing, interfacing, GUI, etc


Why not Python? 
Too slow for audio processing.


Why not use Python for GUI? 
JUCE already is a robust system for rendering music-related GUI elements. More complex rendering can be done with OpenGL.




IDE: Visual Studio Community 2022

GUI DESIGN


Graph


Visual sheet music space for rendering musical instructions in higher pitch-definition than 12-tone equal temperament used in contemporary classical music.


Resizable ONLY SCALED both horizontally and vertically, not either-or.


??? Allow for independence of beat and time from horizontal visual space, as in classical sheet music? Or choose a time-based horizontal scale and force that? Or allow for certain sections of music to each have their own time-based horizontal scale and force consistency within the section?
